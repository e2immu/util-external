/**
 * Example of a freezable set, which disallows both removal and attempts to write an object a second time.
 * Implemented as a map, so you can retrieve the exact object you put in using the <code>get</code> method.
 * Elements must not be null.
 * <p>
 * The type is eventually level 2 immutable since its only field <code>set</code> is explicitly final,
 * after freezing, it cannot be modified anymore, and it is independent because the only way of obtaining
 * the whole set is via a {@link Stream}, or, when in Java 10 or higher, via a level 2 immutable copy.
 * <p>
 * This is an example class! Please extend and modify for your needs.
