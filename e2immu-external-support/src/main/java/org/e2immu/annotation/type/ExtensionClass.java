 * <li>the class is immutable or constant;</li>
 * <li>all non-private static methods with parameters (and there must be at least one) must have a 1st parameter:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>of type <code>E</code>, the type being extended,</li>

 * Extension classes will often not be {@link Container}, because a modification of the first parameter
