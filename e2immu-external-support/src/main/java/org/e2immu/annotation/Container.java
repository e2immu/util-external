 * An annotation on a type (computed on a class, contracted on an interface) that indicates that no method of the type
 * modifies its parameters.

 * The annotation on a field, parameter or method indicates a dynamic value, typically computed for concrete
 * implementations of functional interfaces.
 * <p>
 * The annotation can be contracted on a parameter to indicate that all implementations of the (abstract) type
 * must be containers themselves. This is particularly useful for functional interfaces, where the annotation will
 * enforce that implementations are not parameter-modifying.
