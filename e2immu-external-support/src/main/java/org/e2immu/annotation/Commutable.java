/**
 * Annotation occurring on a parameter or a method.
 * <p>
 * On a parameter, it indicates that the parameter is exchangeable with other parameters in the same commutation group,
 * i.e., when present on the first two parameters of a method, <code>method(a, b, c)</code> is fully equivalent to
 * <code>method(b, a, c)</code>.
 * The two standard examples are <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> in the {@link java.lang.Math} class,
 * and the two-parameter <code>of(x, y)</code> method in {@link java.util.Set}.
 * <p>
 * When applied to methods, it indicates that the order of execution is interchangeable.
 * Currently, this system applies to modifying methods only.
 *
 * <p>
 * The parameters help describe the commutation properties:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Without this annotation, the default is sequential; in a formula: S(main).
 * <li>With this annotation, without parameters, a parallel group is created: @Commutable is equivalent to S(main)P(default).
 * <li>Two different parallel groups can be created using the 'par' parameter: @Commutable(par="group1") implies S(main)P(group1).
 * <li>A sequential group within the default parallel group is created using the 'seq' parameter: @Commutable(seq="s")
 * implies S(main)P(default)S(s).
 * <li>The 'multi' parameter indicates that multiple calls to the same method can be grouped by the method mentioned in the parameter;
 * see e.g. multiple calls to `Collection.add()` can be replaced by a single `Collection.addAll()` call.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The parameters either take a group name, or a comma separated list of group name and method parameter index.
 * <p>
 * Note that setters (annotated with {@link org.e2immu.annotation.method.GetSet}), are commutable in the
 * default parallel group. The <code>@Commutable</code> annotation is implied.
