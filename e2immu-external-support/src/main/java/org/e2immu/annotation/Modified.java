 * Opposite of {@link NotModified}. On a method, it indicates that the method modifies a field, either
 * by assigning to it, or calling another method which does.
 * On a field, it indicates that there exists a method which changes the object graph of the field.
 * On a parameter, it indicates that somehow through the class, the object represented by the parameter
 * is modified.
 * <p>
 * Non-modification is a requirement for fields of a level 2 immutable type.
 * Fields of implicitly immutable type cannot be modified in a type.

 * Please refer to the <em>e2immu</em> manual for an in-depth discussion of this concept.
