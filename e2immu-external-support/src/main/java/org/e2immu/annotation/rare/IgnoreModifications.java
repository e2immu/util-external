/**
 * Annotation used to indicate that modifications on a field or parameter can be ignored.
 * The simple use case is <code>System.out</code>, where <code>println</code> is a modifying
 * method. To your application, however, this may not count as a modification but rather
 * as an action external to the system.
 * <p>
 * The use case for parameters is a <code>forEach</code> method which takes a consumer as a
 * parameter. Modifications inside the implementation of the <code>accept</code> method of the
 * consumer should typically not prevent the type of the <code>forEach</code> method to become a container.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is always contracted, never computed.
