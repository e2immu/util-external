/**
 * Annotation on a method, always contracted, indicating that after calling this method,
 * no other methods may be called anymore on the object. After calling a finalizer, the
 * object has gone into a <em>final</em> state.
 * <p>
 * The analyser imposes strict rules for the life-cycle of objects with a finalizer method:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>
 *         Any field of a type with finalizers must be effectively final (marked with {@link Final}).
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         A finalizer method can only be called on a field inside a method which is marked as a finalizer as well.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         A finalizer method can never be called on a parameter or any variable linked to it,
 *         with linking as in {@link Linked}.
 *     </li>
 * </ol>
 * These rules allow the analyser to enforce the final state of the object.
